# Note Taker - Express.js

## My Task

My assignment was to modify a starter code and use Express.js and back end strategies to create an application called Note Taker. This application can be used to write and store notes considering that input is saved and can be retrieved from a JSON file.

The application only required new back end development because all of the front end was already taken care and created. My job was to construct back end, connect it, and then deploy it to Heroku.
